## What is lazycap?

**lazycap** is a beautiful terminal-based dashboard for [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) mobile development. It brings together device management, builds, live reload, and debugging into one unified interface — no more juggling multiple terminal windows.

Think of it as the control center for your mobile development workflow.

## Features

- **Device Management** — View all connected iOS simulators, Android emulators, and physical devices in one place
- **One-Key Actions** — Run, build, sync, and open IDE with single keystrokes
- **Live Reload** — Start live reload sessions with automatic device targeting
- **Web Development** — Integrated web dev server with smart framework detection
- **Process Management** — Monitor running processes with real-time log streaming
- **Debug Tools** — Built-in cleanup and diagnostic actions for common issues
- **Plugin System** — Extend functionality with MCP Server, Firebase Emulator, and more
- **Preflight Checks** — Automatic environment validation on startup
- **Beautiful UI** — Capacitor-inspired design with intuitive keyboard navigation

## Plugins

lazycap features a powerful plugin system for extending functionality. Plugins can control all aspects of the application including devices, processes, settings, and debug actions.

### Built-in Plugins

#### MCP Server

Exposes lazycap functionality via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing AI assistants like Claude to control your development environment.

**Claude Code Integration:**

Add lazycap to your Claude Code MCP settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lazycap": {
      "command": "lazycap",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or run lazycap in your Capacitor project directory with the working directory specified:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lazycap": {
      "command": "lazycap",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/capacitor-project"
    }
  }
}
```

**Available Tools:**
- `list_devices` — Get all available devices and emulators
- `run_on_device` — Run app on a specific device with optional live reload
- `sync` — Sync web assets to native projects
- `build` — Build the web assets
- `open_ide` — Open Xcode or Android Studio
- `get_project` — Get current Capacitor project info
- `get_debug_actions` — List available debug/cleanup actions
- `run_debug_action` — Execute a debug action

**Plugin Configuration (for TUI mode):**
| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `mode` | Server mode: `tcp` or `stdio` | `tcp` |
| `port` | TCP port (when mode is tcp) | `9315` |
| `autoStart` | Start server on launch | `false` |

#### Firebase Emulator

Integrates [Firebase Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) for local development with Firebase services.

**Features:**
- Auto-detects `firebase.json` in your project
- Manages emulator lifecycle (start/stop)
- Supports data import/export
- Shows running emulator status in header

**Configuration:**
| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `autoStart` | Start emulators on launch | `false` |
| `importPath` | Path to import data from | — |
| `exportOnExit` | Export data when stopping | `true` |
| `exportPath` | Path to export data to | `.firebase-export` |
| `uiEnabled` | Enable Emulator UI | `true` |

### Managing Plugins

Press `P` to open the plugins panel where you can:
- View all installed plugins and their status
- Start/stop plugins with `Enter`
- Enable/disable plugins with `e`

Plugin settings are persisted in `~/.config/lazycap/plugins.json`.

### Creating Plugins

lazycap plugins implement the `Plugin` interface:

```go
type Plugin interface {
    ID() string
    Name() string
    Description() string
    Version() string
    Author() string

    Init(ctx Context) error
    Start() error
    Stop() error
    IsRunning() bool

    GetSettings() []Setting
    OnSettingChange(key string, value interface{})
    GetStatusLine() string
    GetCommands() []Command
}
```

Plugins have access to the full application context including:
- Device listing and selection
- Process management and logs
- Settings (read/write)
- Debug actions
- Event bus for reactive updates

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed plugin development documentation.

## Configuration

### Settings

Press `,` to open the settings panel. Settings are organized by category:

**General**
- Live reload default behavior
- Verbose output

**Web Development**
- Dev server command (auto-detected or custom)
- Port and host configuration
- Auto-open browser
- HTTPS mode

Settings are stored in `~/.config/lazycap/settings.json`.

### Project Configuration

lazycap automatically detects your Capacitor configuration from:
- `capacitor.config.ts`
- `capacitor.config.js`
- `capacitor.config.json`

## Debug Tools
